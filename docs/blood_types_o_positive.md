## You Have the Power To Save Lives

Type O+ blood is given to patients more than any other blood type, which is why it is considered the most needed blood type. Your blood is compatible with any red blood cells that are positive. In fact, 38% of the population has this blood type.  
  
When seconds count in major trauma situations, many hospitals will transfuse O+ blood, even when the patient’s blood type is unknown. We count on your donation because your blood is one of the first types to run out during a shortage due to its high demand.
