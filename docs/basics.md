# Blood Donation Basics

**Giving blood is as easy as 1, 2, 3.** It can take 15 minutes to about an hour, but your impact will last a lifetime. Discover more about how to donate and share your power to save lives.

## 1\. Registration

When you arrive at the Big Red Bus® or donor center, simply check in with a valid photo ID and fill out a private Donor Health Questionnaire (DHQ).

 

## 2\. Health Screening

We check your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, cholesterol, and hemoglobin level. We also review your medical history and determine your eligibility status for donating blood based on your responses to the DHQ.

 

## 3\. Donation

Sit back, relax, and save lives! If you are giving a whole blood donation, the procedure only takes about 10-15 minutes, followed by a brief period for rest and refreshments.

## Donation Methods

There is more than one way to give blood. Let your blood type take the lead in targeting the best way for you to donate your powerful, lifesaving gift.

# 

 Whole Blood Donation

Whole blood donation is the method that individuals are most familiar with. This is the traditional way of donating and allows us to draw a pint of blood containing red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma at one time.

 Double Red Cell Donation

During a double red blood cell donation we only collect your red blood cells, excluding the platelets and plasma. This specialized donation process, known as automation or apheresis, focuses on extracting red blood cells.

 Platelet Donation

During a platelet donation, we only collect your platelets, returning the rest of the blood components. This specialized donation process is known as automation, or apheresis.
