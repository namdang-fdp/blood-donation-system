## You Have the Power To Save Lives

About 9% of the population has B+ blood. Your blood can be transfused to both B+ and AB+ patients. In trauma situations and surgeries, it is important to have your blood type readily available.  
  
Your platelets are the most powerful part of your B+ blood. Platelets can be donated as often as every seven days, recommended every 14 days, and up to 24 times a year. Platelets are in high demand by hospitals and help cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Red blood cells from B+ donors also hold lifesaving power. Depending on hospital need, a whole blood donation might also be preferred.
