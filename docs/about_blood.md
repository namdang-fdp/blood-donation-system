# What Is Blood?

There is no substitute for blood, and it cannot be manufactured in a lab. The only source for patients in need of a transfusion is volunteer blood donations.

## There Are Four Basic Components That Comprise Human Blood

 Red Blood Cells

**_Red blood cells_** represent 40-45% of your blood volume. They are generated from your bone marrow at a rate of 4 to 5 billion per hour. They have a lifecycle of about 120 days in the body.  

 Platelets

**_Platelets_** are the smallest of your blood cells and literally look like small plates in their non-active form. Platelets control bleeding. Wherever a wound occurs, the blood vessel will send out a signal. Platelets receive that signal and travel to the area and transform into their “active” formation, growing long tentacles to make contact with the vessel and form clusters to plug the wound until it heals.  

 Plasma

**_Plasma_** is the liquid portion of your blood. Plasma is made up mostly of water, but it also contains proteins, sugars, hormones, and salts. It transports water and nutrients to your body’s tissues.  

White Blood Cells

**_White blood cells_** (leukocytes) only account for about 1% of your blood. They are essential for good health and protection against illness and disease. Like red blood cells, they are constantly being generated from your bone marrow. They flow through the bloodstream and attack foreign bodies, like viruses and bacteria.

## Why Blood Is Needed

Blood cannot be manufactured outside the body and has a limited shelf life. The supply must constantly be replenished by generous blood donors.

#### 62%

Approximately 62% of the population is eligible to donate blood.

## How Blood Is Used

There are many reasons patients need blood:

*   More than 25% of the blood supply is used by patients battling cancer
*   1 out of every 83 childbirths will require a blood transfusion
*   The second most common medical procedure in U.S. hospitals is the transfusion of blood and blood products
*   3.2% of the blood supply is used to treat pediatric patients

## Making an Impact

Platelets play a vital role in the clotting process, which helps control bleeding and promotes healing. Patients with certain medical conditions, such as cancer, blood disorders, or those undergoing organ transplants, often experience a decrease in platelet count or function.
