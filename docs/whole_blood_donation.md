## Making an Impact

Each whole blood donation is separated into its component parts: red cells, plasma, and platelets. This means your whole blood donation can be transfused to up to three patients. Whole blood donations play a vital role in saving the lives of patients battling cancer, blood disorders, traumatic injuries, and other critical conditions.
