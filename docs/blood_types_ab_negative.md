## You Have the Power To Save Lives

Only 1% of the population has AB- blood, making it the rarest blood type. Donors who are AB- are the universal plasma donor because this component can be transfused into any patient, regardless of the recipient’s blood type.  
  
Your platelets and plasma are the most powerful parts of your AB- blood. Platelets can be donated as often as every seven days, recommended every 14 days, and up to 24 times a year. Platelets are in high demand by hospitals and help cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
