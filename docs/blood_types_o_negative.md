## You Have the Power To Save Lives

As an O- blood donor, you are the universal red cell donor. That is because your red blood cells can be transfused to any patient, regardless of the recipient’s blood type. However, only 7% of the population has this versatile blood type.  
  
When seconds count, emergency room doctors often do not have time to determine the blood type of the patient and will depend on O- blood to help save lives in these situations. Because of this, your blood type is in the highest demand.
