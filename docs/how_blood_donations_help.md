## Who Can You Help by Donating Blood?

###### Cancer Patients

**Ideal Blood Type**

A positive, A negative, B positive, O positive, AB positive and AB negative

Racing Toward Life - Brian Boyle

Brian lost 60% of his blood. He required 36 blood transfusions and 13 plasma treatments, which he received from Red Cross donors.

###### Sickle Cell Patients

**Ideal Donation Type**

Whole blood or Power Red, especially from blood donors who are of African descent. Patients with sickle cell disease, who are predominantly Black, can require multiple blood transfusions every year. Donated blood must be very closely matched to the donor’s blood type to avoid transfusion-related complications. Since most patients with sickle cell disease are Black or African American, the most compatible blood type match is most often from a donor of the same race or ethnicity.

**Ideal Blood Type**

Type O, especially from blood donors who are Black.
