## Your Donation

*   We’ll cleanse an area on your arm and insert a new sterile needle for the blood draw. (This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.)
*   A whole blood donation takes about 8-10 minutes, during which you’ll be seated comfortably or lying down while approximately a pint of whole blood is collected.
*   For a Power Red donation, a device will use a single-use kit to collect two units of packed red blood cells and return your plasma along with saline through the same sterile needle in approximately 45 minutes.
*   For plasma, a device will use a single-use kit to collect plasma and return your red cells and platelets along with saline through the same sterile needle in approximately 45 minutes.
*   For platelets, a device will use a single-use kit to collect the platelets and a small amount of plasma and return the rest of your blood through a sterile needle in your other arm in approximately two hours.
*   When your donation is complete, a staff person will place a bandage on your arm and provide post donation instructions.
