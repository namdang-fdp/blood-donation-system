## You Have the Power To Save Lives

As an A- donor, your blood type is rare. Only 6%, or 1 in 16 people, have A- blood. You can donate blood to anyone with a blood type of A or AB, regardless of whether they are positive or negative.  
  
Your donation is often transfused within just three days. That's why your donation is important, and we count on you to give whenever you are eligible.
