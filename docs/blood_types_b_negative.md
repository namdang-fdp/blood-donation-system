## You Have the Power To Save Lives

Only 2% of the population has B- blood. Your blood type can be transfused to B and AB patients. Since both of these types are rare, your donations make a difference to make sure blood products are available when needed.  
  
Every two seconds, someone needs blood. The need for blood is constant, for reasons ranging from surgeries to cancer treatments to traumatic injuries. Your donation is often transfused within just three days.
