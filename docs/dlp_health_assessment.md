## Free Health Screening and Blood Tests

![Your Health Screening]

Your Health Screening

When you come in to donate, you help provide lifesaving care to patients in need. But you also receive the added benefit of a free mini-health assessment, provided by a trained Red Cross staff member.  

Prior to donating blood, all donors will receive a free health screening. At the time of your donation, your blood pressure, hemoglobin, and pulse will be checked. We record these vitals in your online donor profile where you can track and monitor your results. You can access this information as well as past health information obtained during prior donations, at any time. Your online profile is a great resource to track your health goals and share with your care providers. Your health is an important part of your donor journey and key to continuing to help others in need.

## What is done during the test and what is measured

Prior to donating blood, all donors will receive a free health screening. At the time of your donation, your blood pressure, hemoglobin and pulse will be checked. We record these vitals in your online donor profile. You can access this information as well as past health information obtained during prior donations, at any time. We encourage you to share your results with your healthcare provider at your next visit.

Blood Pressure

The Red Cross checks your blood pressure before every donation. When untreated, high blood pressure can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and other health complications. Also known as hypertension, the condition usually has no symptoms, and is often called the "silent killer."

Pulse

Your pulse will be checked before every Red Cross blood donation. Staff will measure the number of times your heart beats per minute and count any irregular heartbeats. Your pulse rate gives insights into your heart rhythm and how well your heart may be working. A heart rate that is too fast, too slow, or irregular can indicate an underlying condition.

Hemoglobin

The Red Cross checks your hemoglobin before every donation to ensure that you are healthy enough to donate. Hemoglobin is a protein that contains iron and carries oxygen to the tissues in your body. Iron is essential to help your body to replace new red blood cells lost through blood donations.

 How are infectious diseases tested on donated blood?

Every unit of blood is tested to identify the donor's blood group (O, A, B or AB) and Rh type, and screened for atypical or unusual red cell antibodies.
