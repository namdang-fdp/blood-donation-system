Why Give Blood

## Why Give Blood

You don't need a special reason to give blood. You just need your own reason.

*   Some of us give blood because we were asked by a friend.
*   Some know that a family member or a friend might need blood some day.
*   Some believe it is the right thing to do.
*   Some do it for the free cookies and juice.

 

**Everyone enjoys the great feeling of helping save lives!**
