## You Have the Power To Save Lives

As an A+ donor, your blood type is the second most common type. In fact, 34% of the population has this blood type.  
  
Your platelets are the most powerful part of your A+ blood. Platelets can be donated as often as every seven days, recommended every 14, and up to 24 times a year. Platelets are in high demand by hospitals and help cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, depending on hospital need, a whole blood donation might be preferred.
