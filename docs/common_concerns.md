## Common Concerns

Many people are reluctant to make their first blood donation, but once they do, they find the donation process to be easy and gratifying. 

I Don't Like Needles

#### I Don't Like Needles

You’re not alone: fear of needles certainly prevents some people from donating blood. But if you’re willing to spend a few minutes facing your fears (donating really can be that fast) you may find that the satisfaction you feel makes it worth it.

**Try the Helpful Tips Below:**

Take Pride

Try to focus on the good you are doing - your blood donation can help save more than one life.

Before your appointment, read up on the donation process so you know what to expect at every step.

Relax

Listen to music, read a book, talk to our staff, or simply close your eyes and rest for a few minutes.

Is it Safe to Donate?

#### Is it Safe to Donate?

Yes, donating blood is safe. You can’t get AIDS or any other infectious disease from giving blood because we always use new, sterile needles that are discarded after one use.  

You’ll even be given a mini-physical at your appointment, to ensure you are healthy enough to donate that day. We’ll check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse and hemoglobin.

I'm Afraid I'll Faint

#### I'm Afraid I'll Faint

Most donors feel fine after donating blood, but if you do feel faint or fatigued, simply lie down until you feel better. It might help you to think about this: you have about 10 pints of blood in your body. Roughly 1 pint is given during a donation. Your body can replenish that loss in a short time (a matter of hours for some components, a few weeks for others).
